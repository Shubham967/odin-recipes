         <h2>Description</h2>
         <p>This classic lasagna recipe is made with an easy meat sauce as the base. Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly! This is great for feeding a big family and freezes well, too.</p>
         <h2>Ingredients</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>3 ounces tomato paste (half a 6-ounce can)</li>
         </ul>
         <h2>Steps</h2>
         <ol>
            <li>Put pasta water on to boil</li>
            <p>Put a large pot of salted water (1 tablespoon of salt for every 2 quarts of water) on the stovetop on high heat. It can take a while for a large pot of water to come to a boil (this will be your pasta water), so prepare the sauce in the next steps while the water is heating.</p>
            <li>Brown the ground beef</li>
            <p>In a large skillet heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high heat. Add the ground beef and cook until it is lightly browned on all sides.</p>
            <li>Cook the bell pepper, onions, and garlic; add back the beef</li>
            <p>Add the diced bell pepper and onions to the skillet (in the photo we are using yellow bell pepper and red onions).</p>
         </ol>
