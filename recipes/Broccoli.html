         <h2>Description</h2>
         <p>This broccoli bake is a great casserole I threw together one day when a friend requested broccoli au gratin for her birthday dinner. This is a great idea for those who aren't big fans of bread crumbs. The eggs can be taken out for a terrific sauce; skim milk and fat-free cheese also work well. It's a great recipe that can be easily altered according to taste. Enjoy!</p>
         <h2>Ingredients</h2>
         <ul>

            <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
         </ul>
         <h2>Steps</h2>
